# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project provides an analytical overview of COVID-19 trends across selected countries — **Kenya**, **India**, and the **United States** — using global data. The analysis covers confirmed cases, death rates, and vaccination progress from the start of the pandemic to the most recent available data.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Track and visualize the progression of total COVID-19 cases over time.
- Analyze the death rate trends (total deaths / total cases).
- Assess vaccination rollout and progress.
- Create comparative visualizations across countries.
- Highlight key findings and patterns from the data.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- `pandas` — for data loading, filtering, and manipulation
- `matplotlib` — for data visualization (line and pie charts)
- `seaborn` — for enhanced visual styling
- `plotly.express` — for creating choropleth maps (optional task)
- Jupyter Notebook — as the primary analysis environment
